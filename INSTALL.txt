INSTALLATION
============

1) Download and enable this module on your Drupal site

2) Install behat on your machine following these instructions:
   http://docs.behat.org/quick_intro.html#installation
   
3) Copy file "behat.yml" and directory "features" to 
   site root directory.
   
4) Customize the path to "behat/bootstrap" in behat.yml
   if the behat module isn't located at "sites/all/modules/behat"
   
5) Set $base_url in settings.php if your site is not 
   accessible at http://localhost/ 
   (otherwise drupalPost() won't work)
   
   There's no way yet to tell Behat to run a specific site within
   a multisite setup. 
   Make sure that sites/default/settings.php exists, otherwise 
   behat will exit without an error message.
   
6) Test if behat is set up correctly and switch to the shell, 
   change to the Drupal root directory and run:
   
   $ behat
   
   This should execute the example feature.


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

If you get the error "Base table or view not found: 1146 Table 'drupal.simpletest_test_id'", make sure you have enabled the behat module on your test site.

If you get the error "Context class "ClosuredFeatureContext" not found and can not be instantiated", "%%BEHAT_CONFIG_PATH%%" might not be resolving in /path/to/drupal/behat.yml. You might have to replace %%BEHAT_CONFIG_PATH%% with your /path/to/drupal.
